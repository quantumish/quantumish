### Hi!
I'm David. I'm a student currently studying CS at Carnegie Mellon University who is interested in computer systems and functional programming! I especially like databases and compilers. You can also find me at my website - https://quantumi.sh.

Some things I've built in my free time include an [OSX kernel extension](https://github.com/quantumish/msrutil), [lock-free data structures](https://github.com/quantumish/threadutils), an [ML framework](https://github.com/quantumish/Jacobian), a [multiplayer exchange simulator](https://github.com/quantumish/exchange), a custom [HTTP server](https://github.com/bunkum), and more!
