### Hi!
I'm David. I'm a student currently studying CS at Carnegie Mellon University who is interested in computer systems, functional programming, writing fast code, and much more! 

I also have a (very under-construction) website at [quantumi.sh](https://quantumi.sh) - this bio is taken from there!
